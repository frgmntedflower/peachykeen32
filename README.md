# PeachyKeen32 (sh)

Name inspired by my girlfriend (<3) who just gave me a Monster Peachy Keen which is so good that I had to write a shell in ARM.

## Awesome features

### Command support

#### `fwrite`

**Usage:**

fwrite "string to write to file" filename

**Description:**

`fwrite` currently allows you to write a string to a file. If the file doesn't exist, it will create it for you. I know, cool right? ^~^*
