# PeachyKeen32 (sh)

Name inspired by my girlfriend (<3) who just gave me a Monster Peachy Keen which is so good that I had to write a shell in ARM.

## ‚ú® Features

- REPL-style input loop (`peachykeen32>`)

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a toy shell made for fun and low-level exploration. It will yell at you, crash on unknown commands, and has no interest in POSIX compliance. You‚Äôve been warned.
